# Introduction

This is a simple demonstration of using PaLM combined with a Line Bot. Before using it, make sure you have configured other Django parameters. These code segments should be placed in `views.py`.

# Parameters

There are four parameters that you should set yourself:

1. `__YOUR_LINE_BOT_API__`
2. `__YOUR_PARSER__`
3. `__YOUR_API_KEY__`
4. `__YOUR_PROMPT`

It is recommended to obtain the first three through file reading. This example demonstrates direct plaintext coding.
